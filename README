This is an input method (initially based off the ibus-tmpl template).

You can use this input method as a short-cut to using character maps. e.g. you can type "GREEK ALPHA", and it will offer you the Unicode characters corresponding to `Greek capital letter alpha with tonos', `Greek capital letter alpha', `Greek small letter alpha' etc. It will also show you the unicode sequence.

It is hoped that with repeated usage, the user will remember the unicode sequence rather than the description of the characters.

It is also hoped that this could be integrated with other input methods / keyboards. Currently iBus supports Ctrl+Shift+U <unicode sequence> to enter unicode characters. However, this only works as well as you can remember the unicode sequences. And character maps can be a pain, especially if you start to use a lot of Greek letters in your LibreOffice report (strictly speaking, you should use TeX. But, really...). If one could <Ctrl>+<Shift>+<U> <'> followed by a description, it might work a lot more nicely.

This project stores data in a SQLite3 database.

Problems:
- Installation doesn't really work yet, for reasons I have yet to uncover
- engine/engine.py still refers to my home directory, because SQLite3 on Python needs write-access (oh bother)
- UnicodeData.txt is in English! This project cannot ever be localized, can it? (e.g. 阿拉法、俄梅戛 -- Chinese for `alpha' and `omega')
- Data currently only comes from UnicodeData.txt. Unihan, CJK radicals etc. have not been included yet.
- Needs usage frequency tracking!
